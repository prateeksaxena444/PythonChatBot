"explain stock split": 
"A stock split is an action by the board of a company in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares. This action is performed to split their shares so that  they can lower the trading price of their stock to a lower price so that more investors are attracted and liquidity of the share is increased. Example: If you have 100 shares worth Rs 50 each, after split it would turn to 200 shares worth Rs 25 each. Hence making price of the share more attractive without any change in market cap.",

"what is upper circuit and lower circuit?": 
"In order for a stock not to be allowed to freely move upwards or fall downwards, exchanges usually limit the maximum (and minimum) price moment of the stock. An upper circuit is the maximum price to which a stock is allowed to move upwards and similarly a lower circuit is the minimum price to which a stock is allowed to fall downwards. This range varies from 5% to 20% depending on the stock price. Example if CMP of a stock is 100 Rs, it can move upward by a maximum of 20% in a single trading day. (ie 20% of 100 = 100 + 20 = Rs 120) Similarly, it is restricted to not fall below 20% in a single trading day. (ie 20% of 100 = 100 - 20 = Rs 80)",
